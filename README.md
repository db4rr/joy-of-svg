# The Joy of SVG

Hi there! This repository includes materials for a workshop on Scalable Vector Graphics, first delivered on June 2019 at the [soap! conference](http://soapconf.com/schedule2019/) in beautiful Krak√≥w, Poland.

## Why SVG?
  - Scalable: rendered in any size and resolution
  - Created by drawing vectors that have strokes and fills
  - XML-based: easily translated
  - Can be controlled with CSS and JavaScript
